# Prakriti-Identification-using-Tridoshas

This project explores the fusion of Ayurveda and machine learning to classify human Prakriti (body constitution) types into Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. The project performed excellent to Random Forest-based ensemble model to achieve high accuracy, providing a scientific method for personalized health insights based on Ayurveda. A detailed project PDF has been created and uploaded to the repository, covering the projectâ€™s entire flow, including methodology, feature extraction, and results analysis.

## Proposed Methodology
Explanation of the Random Forest Prakriti Classification (RFPC) method, along with hyperparameter tuning and ensemble learning strategies. A methodology diagram is provided below to illustrate this process.

## Results and Analysis
Achieved 98% accuracy using Random Forest. The results analysis table below presents performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) for each Prakriti class.

## Publication
Our research paper based on this project has been successfully published in the IEEE Xplore proceedings of the IACIS 2024 conference. This publication highlights the use of ensemble learning models for predicting human body Prakriti using Ayurvedic Tridosha features, providing a scientific basis for integrating machine learning with traditional Ayurvedic principles.
