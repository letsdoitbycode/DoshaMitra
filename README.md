# Prakriti-Identification-using-Tridoshas

This project explores the fusion of Ayurveda and machine learning to classify human Prakriti (body constitution) types into Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. The project performed excellent to Random Forest-based ensemble model to achieve high accuracy, providing a scientific method for personalized health insights based on Ayurveda. A detailed project PDF has been created and uploaded to the repository, covering the project’s entire flow, including methodology, feature extraction, and results analysis.


## Proposed Methodology
Explanation of the Random Forest Prakriti Classification (RFPC) method, along with hyperparameter tuning and ensemble learning strategies. A methodology diagram is provided below to illustrate this process.

#### Abstract: 
Ayurveda, an ancient medical system, provides insight into personal health through the concept of Prakriti, which determines a person's constitution. Integrating these traditional concepts with modern medical practice is a huge challenge. The research has addressed this problem by developing a machine learning-based Prakriti estimation method. Advanced algorithms, including random forests and ensemble models, were used to analyze a rich dataset of biological traits not easily altered by current cosmetic or technological interventions. This approach achieved a remarkable accuracy of 98\%, validating the effectiveness of integrating machine learning and Ayurvedic principles. Future research will focus on expanding the dataset to include a wider range of biological features and improving feature selection methods to increase the generalizability and applicability of the model in various clinical settings, thereby improving the relationship between traditional Ayurvedic knowledge and modern medical practice. The gap must be narrowed further. keywords: {Accuracy;Machine learning algorithms;Biological system modeling;Estimation;Medical services;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Random forests;IEEE Constitution;Faces;machine learning;health domain;ayurveda;prakriti;prakriti identification;prashna pariksha},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10721947&isnumber=10721618
